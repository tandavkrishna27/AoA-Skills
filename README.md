## Skills

| Skill | Key | When to use |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Brainstorm | `skill:aoa-curated/aoa-brainstorm` | A raw or half-formed idea needs pressure-testing before any building starts |
| Identity Setup | `skill:aoa-curated/aoa-identity-setup` | A new or unshaped company needs vision, mission, and identity established |
| Sprint Planning | `skill:aoa-curated/aoa-sprint-planning` | A goal or larger effort needs breaking into several tasks with dependencies |
| Team Design | `skill:aoa-curated/aoa-team-design` | Deciding which agents a company or project should have |
| Office Hours | `skill:aoa-curated/aoa-office-hours` | Weighing a side project, product feature, or strategic bet before committing |
| Investigate | `skill:aoa-curated/aoa-investigate` | An agent run failed, a task is stuck, or an output is wrong and the cause is unclear |
| Spec | `skill:aoa-curated/aoa-spec` | A decided change needs writing up as one backlog-ready task |
| Discussion Facilitation | `skill:aoa-curated/aoa-discussion-facilitation` | A discussion thread needs its decisions, tasks, and insights pulled out |
| Daily Triage | `skill:aoa-curated/aoa-daily-triage` | The user asks what to work on, what needs their attention, what is blocked or at risk, or how a department or the company is doing right now |
| Review Agent Output | `skill:aoa-curated/aoa-review-agent-output` | The user wants an agent's deliverable checked against the task's acceptance criteria before approval, to decide whether to approve it or send it back |
| Delegate & Handoff | `skill:aoa-curated/aoa-delegate-handoff` | The user is ready to hand shaped work to an agent: select an agent, write a task spec, set dependencies, and dispatch it |

## Contributing

Skills in this repo are published to the AoA marketplace via `aoa-marketplace`. Read
[`AUTHORING.md`](./AUTHORING.md) first — it covers description rules (WHEN-only
routing prose), surface-agnostic tool references, the shared-preamble contract,
rigid-vs-flexible self-labeling, and cross-skill referencing conventions. To
update a skill:

1. Edit the `.md` file in `skills/`
2. Run `bun run validate` to check tool names
3. Open a PR — CI will validate automatically
4. After merge, run `scripts/sync-to-marketplace.sh` to publish
